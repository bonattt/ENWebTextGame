			<h3  class="tip-header"> Saving </h3>
			<p class="tip-body">
                Saving requires you to save your character to
				a JSON file and download it. Then you reupload it, and
				continue from there. I'm hardly an ace webdeveloper. Quite
				the opposite, really, my strength is in design and writing.
				And I'm doing this all by my lonesome. And for free! So the
				point is you get what you paid for, and probably more. Plus,
				if you're smart, you could cheat pretty hard by editing your
				save file, but I don't see much point in that, really.
